# Smart Light

The Smart Light is a centrally controlled IoT-enabled light bulb prototype designed for versatile use in various settings, including street lamps and indoor lighting. It offers two modes of operation: manual and automatic, allowing for dynamic adjustment of illumination. Both modes feature options for high or low-intensity lighting, aimed at reducing operating costs. The product also includes fault detection capabilities, enabling remote monitoring and minimizing downtime of failed lighting systems. With no need for batteries, the product operates efficiently on standard 230V AC mains supply.
